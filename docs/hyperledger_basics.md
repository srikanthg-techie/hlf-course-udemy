# Hyperledger Basics

## Definition:
  * Hyperledger is an ubrella project of open source Blockchain and related tools started in December 2015 by the Linux foundation.
  * The Linux Foundation has 800+ members (companies) and 50+ active projects as of 2018.
  
## HYPERLEDGER : Blockchain Technologies for Business
  * Hyperledger is one of the Linux Foundation projects
  * It is incubator for Blockchain Technologies that promotes Re-use
  
  * **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Frameworks:**
    * **Hyperledger SAWTOOTH:**
      * Hyperledger Sawtooth is a modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers. Hyperledger Sawtooth includes a novel consensus algorithm, Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), which targets large distributed validator populations with minimal resource consumption.
    * **Hyperledger IROHA:**
      * Hyperledger Iroha is a business blockchain framework designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural projects requiring distributed ledger technology.
    * **Hyperledger FABRIC:**
      * Intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture, Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play.
    * **Hyperledger Burrow:**
      * Hyperledger Burrow is a permissionable smart contract machine. The first of its kind when released in December, 2014, Burrow provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter built in part to the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
    * **Hyperledger INDY:**
      * Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger, purpose-built for decentralized identity. It provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using independent digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers for interoperability.
      
  * **Tools:**
    * **Hyperledger Caliper:**
      * Hyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark tool, which allows users to measure the performance of a specific blockchain implementation with a set of predefined use cases.
    * **Hyperledger CELLO:**
      * Hyperledger Cello aims to bring the on-demand “as-a-service” deployment model to the blockchain ecosystem to reduce the effort required for creating, managing and terminating blockchains.
    * **Hyperledger COMPOSER:**
      * Hyperledger Composer is a collaboration tool for building blockchain business networks, accelerating the development of smart contracts and their deployment across a distributed ledger.
    * **Hyperledger EXPLORER:**
      * Hyperledger Explorer can view, invoke, deploy or query blocks, transactions and associated data, network information, chain codes and transaction families, as well as any other relevant information stored in the ledger.
    * **Hyperledger QUILT:**
      * Hyperledger Quilt offers interoperability between ledger systems by implementing ILP, which is primarily a payments protocol and is designed to transfer value across distributed ledgers and non-distributed ledgers.

## HYPERLEDGER FABRIC:
  * Production ready Blockchain framework for Business blockchain applicaions.
  * It's a framework with set of infrastructure and application building blocks.
  * Provides practices and guidelines for creating Blockchain apps.

## Hyperledger COMPOSER:
  * Blockchain tool for creating business applications on Hyperledger DLT frameworks.
